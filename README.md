# Clean the mess!

## Description
This is a simple Web Extension that I've always desired to create! Now it's here, fitting my best purpose. What is this one about? My common workflow in an internet browser comprises of repeated visiting of plenty of usual services such as calendar, email, facebook, my favourite newspapers' articles and many other websites in which I am interested and opening them into a big load of new tabs. Regardless if I mean to vist those websites later or have just visited them, roughly around the half of them ends up never closed. I am terrible with closing tabs. I know and I am sorry. But I came with the idea of an extension that would allow me to close them easily and clean the mess I made!

### How am I going to do that?
The idea is to make a list of opened tabs grouped by the website that's opened in them. The list would show me the number of opened tabs, so I can straightaway hit the table with my forehead in desperation of how messy I am and close them on one click. There will also be a option to pick separate tabs to close or leave opened.

This will solve the most frequent tabs problem, but there will still be a bunch of other sites opened only once or twice, so what's gonna happen with them?

If unused for some amount of time, this extension would offer the user to either save them to favorites or Pocket-like read-later services or simply suggest closing them.

show me the most frequently visited urls, where there is a good chance that I might not need them opened anymore and allow me to close them all at once. These are usually my favorite newspapers, calendar, mail, facebook or google search.
