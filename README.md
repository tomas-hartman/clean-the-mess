# Clean the mess!

Hundreds of opened tabs? Dozens of useless duplicate tabs with opened emails, google searches, your favourite social networks and articles you wanted to read a month ago? Let's clean the mess!

Clean the mess! a simple addon that is designed to help you with maintaining order among opened websites. Unlike some other extensions, first and main purpose of Clean the mess is to help you find and mercilessly close tabs you don't need, not just reorder them.

With its integrated search feature, Clean the mess! could also be used as a fast and simple tab manager, that lets you control your tabs and always find those you opened a week, a month or a year ago. And of course close those you don't find up to date anymore.

**What are Clean the mess's main features?**

- group opened websites by their domain names

## Long Description
This is a simple Web Extension that I've always desired to create! Now it's here, fitting my best purpose. What is this one about? My common workflow in an internet browser comprises of repeated visits to several common services such as calendar, email, facebook, my favourite newspapers' articles and many other websites in which I am interested - and opening them into a big load of new tabs. Regardless if I mean to vist those websites later or have just visited them, roughly around the half of them ends up never closed. I am terrible with closing tabs. I know and I am sorry. But I came with the idea of an extension that would allow me to close them easily and clean the mess I made!

### How am I doing that?
The idea was to make a list of opened tabs grouped by addresses of websites those are opened in them. The list would show me the number of opened tabs (usually a terrifying one) and a list of them with a cute 'close' button. You are then allowed to close either all tabs with the same address at once or you can click on each of the addresses in order to move forward to see detailed links, that can be closed one by one. 

This will solve the problem with the most frequently visited tabs, but there's still a bunch of other sites opened only once or twice, so what's gonna happen with them?

I thought about it as well and the best idea I had was to make a list of 10 tabs unused for the longest period of time, showing detailed information about when they were used the last time, with the possibility to close them instantly. My plan is to implement the bookmarks API in a future version so you can keep these links closed forever in place better suitable for it than is the tab list - in the bookmarks.

That's it. Easy and simple. Enjoy, comment, report bugs!
